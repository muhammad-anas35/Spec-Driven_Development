# Project Plan: Professional Portfolio Website

This document outlines the steps to create a professional, fast, and deployment-ready portfolio website based on the user's specifications.

## 1. Project Setup & Analysis
- Analyze the existing `navbar-project` directory to understand the current structure, dependencies, and scripts.
- Review `package.json`, `next.config.js`, and `tailwind.config.js`.
- Clean up the existing page routes (`/about`, `/services`, etc.) to align with the single-page scroll navigation requirement.

## 2. Research & Theming
- Use **Tavily** to research CSS techniques for implementing an "Apple liquid Glass Theme" (glassmorphism).
- Find a suitable open-source "futuristic" font from a service like Google Fonts.
- Research the implementation of a mouse-following gradient shadow effect using CSS and JavaScript.

## 3. Styling Implementation
- Update `app/globals.css` to include the chosen font and define base styles for the glassmorphism theme (e.g., body background, default text styles).
- Configure `tailwind.config.js` with any custom theme settings (colors, fonts, etc.) required.

## 4. Component Development
All components will be developed as Next.js Server Components by default to ensure fast server-side rendering, except for interactive UI elements which will be Client Components.

- **Navbar Component (`components/Navbar.js`):**
  - Implement a fixed-position, minimalistic navbar.
  - Add the "Anas" logo on the left.
  - Add navigation links (Skills, Project, Certificate, Contact) on the right.
  - Style the navbar with the glassmorphism effect.
  - Implement the specified gradient shadow hover effect on the links.
  - Ensure the layout is centered with adequate spacing on the sides.

- **Section Components:**
  - Create individual components for each section:
    - `components/Skills.js`
    - `components/Projects.js`
    - `components/Certificates.js`
    - `components/Contact.js`
  - Each component will have a unique ID for scroll navigation (e.g., `id="skills"`).

- **Main Page (`app/page.js`):**
  - Remove existing multi-page content.
  - Assemble the Navbar and all section components into a single, scrollable page.

## 5. Functionality Implementation
- **Smooth Scrolling:**
  - Update the Navbar links (`<a href="#skills">`) to point to the corresponding section IDs.
  - Use CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) to enable smooth scrolling.
- **Mouse-Following Gradient Effect:**
  - Create a new Client Component to manage the mouse-following gradient shadow effect, as this requires browser-side JavaScript.
  - Apply this effect to the main layout.

## 6. Testing
- Use **TestSprite** to conduct automated testing on the final application.
  - Bootstrap TestSprite with the correct project configuration (port, type).
  - Generate a test plan covering the Navbar functionality and section visibility.
  - Execute the tests and analyze the results.
  - Save the test results to a `Test-Report.md` file.

## 7. Finalization
- Review the completed project against all requirements in the `QWEN.md` specification.
- Ensure the code is clean, professional, and ready for deployment.
